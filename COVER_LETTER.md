Hi Javonna,

Took your current AttractWell site and rebuilt the experience to show what a modern, HIPAA-aware therapist website looks like:

**Built this for your project:** {VERCEL_URL}

The demo includes your full service lineup, client inquiry management, session scheduling, and content pages — all designed to feel warm and values-driven, not clinical. Mobile-first with secure intake forms baked in.

Are you using a specific HIPAA-compliant form processor currently, or would that need to be set up from scratch?

The demo covers the core experience — want to walk through what the production migration from AttractWell would look like?
